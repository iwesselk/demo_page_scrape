# Page scan demo
A demo tool to use puppeteer to load a page, wait a moment for content to load, and save content and cookies.

The intent was to demonstrate the feasability for a later project. 

Future goals are
* Allow cli arguments for:
  * Page to load
  * How much time to wait
* Send data to a service, or just to an output file
